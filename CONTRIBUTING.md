# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in this ridesharing optimization project!

## Project Status

This is an **academic research project** completed as part of IEDA3010 coursework. While we appreciate interest and suggestions, please note:

- The primary implementation reflects specific research objectives
- The focus is on demonstrating optimization techniques for educational purposes
- This is not intended as a production-ready system

## How You Can Contribute

### Suggestions Welcome

We welcome:
- Bug reports in the optimization implementation
- Documentation improvements or corrections
- Suggestions for alternative optimization approaches
- Ideas for extending the research

### Opening Issues

When opening an issue, please include:
- Clear description of the problem or suggestion
- Steps to reproduce (for bugs)
- Expected vs. actual behavior
- Your Python and Gurobi version
- Relevant error messages or logs

### Code Contributions

If you'd like to contribute code:

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Create a feature branch**: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
3. **Make your changes** with clear commit messages
4. **Test your changes** thoroughly
5. **Submit a pull request** with:
   - Description of changes
   - Motivation/rationale
   - Any new dependencies added
   - Test results

### Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for Python
- Add docstrings to new functions and classes
- Keep code simple and readable
- Add comments for complex logic
- Update documentation if needed

## Ideas for Extensions

Here are some areas where contributions would be valuable:

### Algorithm Enhancements
- Implement alternative optimization solvers (e.g., OR-Tools, PuLP)
- Add heuristic approaches for faster solutions
- Implement rolling horizon optimization
- Add multi-objective optimization

### Features
- Real-time visualization of matches
- Interactive parameter tuning
- Support for larger datasets
- Performance benchmarking suite
- Comparison with other matching algorithms

### Documentation
- Add more usage examples
- Create video tutorials
- Translate documentation
- Add algorithm complexity analysis
- Write blog posts about the approach

### Testing
- Add unit tests for core functions
- Create integration tests
- Add performance benchmarks
- Validate against known optimal solutions

## Questions?

For questions about:
- **The algorithm**: Review [docs/ALGORITHM.md](docs/ALGORITHM.md)
- **Setup issues**: Check [SETUP.md](SETUP.md)
- **Data format**: See [data/DATA_README.md](data/DATA_README.md)
- **General inquiries**: Open a GitHub issue

## Code of Conduct

Please be respectful and constructive in all interactions. This is an educational project, and we're all here to learn.
